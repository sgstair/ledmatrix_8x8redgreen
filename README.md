Red/Green 8x8 LED Matrix controller

This is a very old project that I haven't touched in a long time. I believe this set of files are correct but if you find any mistakes please let me know.

I described it in detail in this blog post: http://blog.akkit.org/2010/05/23/8x8-led-matrix-controller/  
And the PCB design process is captured in video timelapse here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9d3X24IA4
